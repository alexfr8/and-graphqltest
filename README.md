A simple graphql client for android, usign the github v4 dev api (Graph ql)

# Introduction

Using the Github v4 graphql api I get the categories of the marketplace in a small android client and can see the nodes of all categories in a secondary request.

I used apollo client for android to perform request and I altair as a tool to perform query and get the instrospection of the github schema.

I used OkHTTP from Square to perform and intercept HTTP networking.

# Client

The client is a single fragment page app using MVP arquitecture with a minimalist UI, using some third parti libraries to complete the interface but at 90% is native android sdk work.
